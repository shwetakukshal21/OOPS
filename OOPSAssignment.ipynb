        "\n",
        "Ans- OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It focuses on reusability, modularity, and abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and can hold both state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction → Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation → Binding data (variables) and methods together and restricting direct access (using access modifiers like private).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python, e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__. They enable operator overloading and define object behaviors.\n",

        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child/subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent/superclass), promoting code reuse.\n",

        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",

        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",

        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",

        "Class Method (@classmethod) → Takes cls as the first argument; works with class variables.\n",

        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",

        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",

        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",

        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
